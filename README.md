# What are Foundation Models Cooking in the Post-Soviet World? 

![fun image](./borsch_image.png)

This repository contains food dishes and images of the BORSch dataset. In our paper ["What are Foundation Models Cooking in the Post-Soviet World?"](arxiv.org), we used this dataset to explore Post-Soviet cultural understanding in Russian and Ukrainian models.

## Dataset Structure
The data is split into three sub-datasets:
1. RU (Russian): Dishes collected in the Russian language. This data comes with name, country of origin, and source (wikidata/bootstrapping).
2. UK (Ukrainian): Dishes collected in the Ukrainian language. This data comes with name, country of origin, and source (wikidata/bootstrapping).
3. PARALLEL (Russian/Ukrainian): This is the parallel version of the above two corpuses. **Only dishes from Post-Soviet countries are included**.

Each dish has an ID (given in the ID column). This allows one to trace the dish to its image, in the images subfolder in the RU/UK datasets.
